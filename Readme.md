# Control Modding

This is a repo with code/scripts/tools and documentation on modding Remedy's Control Video Game.
This is **not** in any way, shape, or form an official project and all data found here was compiled from other unofficial sources or by trial and error.

# Current Status

Right now there is only source for an executable 'multitool' with a single tool, binfbx file dumping.

To build the executable use CMake, and from command line run the tool as:

- control-tool binfbx &lt;binfbx file&gt;

The binfbx files can be extracted with [control-unpack](https://github.com/profMagija/control-unpack) from the ep100-000-generic package file, character models are found at objects\characters\intermediate.

# Remedy's binfbx file format specification.

This section tries to describe the binary structure of Remedy's Control video game 3d mesh format with extension .binfbx.

This research is based on the previous on a Blender imported work by user 'volfin' at xentax forums:
https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=21047&start=45#p156665
Most credit goes to them.

While the extension of the format suggests a relation with the known FBX file format the similarity seems start there and end at how strings are stored within the file.

## Strings

The string format used is the same as FBX, a uint32_t character count followed with that many characters. The terminal character '\0' may or may not be included, if it *is* included it is always counted.

Examples:
  6 joint1
  6 joint\0
  7 joint2\0

Always trust the count to find the next field in the file.

This format is the same for all variable length arrays, a uint32_t followed with that many objects of whatever type.

## File Structure

Field names are not in any way official and were selected to best represent the information they contain.

## Binding Skeleton

The skeleton is optional and consists of an array of *joints* (uint32_t count followed by that many joints), if the skeleton is not available the count will just be zero.
The original importer mentions that this can be instead a list of "breakable parts", but that does not make much sence given that no diferentiation is given, most likely "breakable parts" are just a collection of unparented joints.

### Array of Joints

### Uniform Variable Array

For some reason Volfin made the comment on the Blender importer that the count seems to be almost always 16, and thats what I found to be the case, still this is a variable array so:

| Type       |  Name                |  Comment                                                                   |

| See Below  | UniformVariables     | Variable size array of Uniform Variables                                   |

### Uniform Variable

| Type       |  Name               |  Comment                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------|:-------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| string     | Name                | Variable name, probably what you'd ask OpenGL to bind the value to in GLSL, example: "g_bAlphaTest"                                                                                                |
| uint32_t   | VariableType        | Known types: Float = 0x00, Range = 0x01, Color = 0x03, Vector = 0x02, TextureMap = 0x09, TextureSampler = 0x08, Boolean = 0x0C                                                                     |
| Depends    | VariablesValue      | Size of the value depends on type Float = 1 float, Range = 2 floats, Color = 4 floats, Vector = 3 floats, TextureMap = string path to image file, TextureSampler = *NO DATA*, Boolean = 1 uint32_t |

Note: TextureSampler contains no data, likely because you need to generate a texture name or id on DirectX, OpenGL or Vulkan that you will not know until runtime, not sure why have a texture map and a texture sampler yet.

## To Be Continued

Here is where things really confusing and hackish in the importer, it's not that the info is not there, but rather that the way it is layed out is confusing and variable names don't make entire sense. I will try to reorder it better and see if that way I can get some clues on what is what.

|------------|:------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| uint128_t  | Magick                   | Always 0x2. The format uses 128 bit alignment and there is no code check for the Magick number, so it is really unknown whether this is an 8,16,64 or 128 bit number plus padding. |
| uint32_t   | Offset to section start  | Number of bytes after the first 16 bytes of the Magick to the start of the first data section (in practice number of bytes from the address of this field)                         |
| uint32_t   | Size of section in bytes | Size in bytes of the first section of data, this is padded to 128 bits for the next section start.                                                                                 |
| uint32_t   | Subsection count         | Usually 3 (bone transform array, bone parent array, bone id array).                                                                                                                |

| Padding    | 128 bit 0 padding        | Zero padding to align data to 128 bits.                                                                                                                                            |
| uint64_t   | Bone Count               | This is where the first offset points to and contains the total number of bones to be used to extract the data from the subsections.                                               |
| uint64_t[] | Subsection Offset Array  | 64 bit offset array from the start of the section to the start of each subsection, the previous 32 bit offsets point to these which are converted into 64 bit pointers at runtime. |
| float[8]   | Bone Transform Array     | Bone count array of 8 floats representing bone transforms. First subsection offset points here.                                                                                    |
| uint32_t   | Bone Parent Array        | Bone count array of parent indices. Second subsection offset points here.                                                                                                          |

| uint32_t   | Bone Id Array            | Bone count array of bone ids. Each id is calculated as the 32 bit FNV1a hash value of its name. Third subsection offset points here.                                               |
| Padding    | 128 bit 0 padding        | Zero padding to align data to 128 bits.                                                                                                                                            |
| uint32_t   | Offset to section start  | This second main section contains bone names (in practice number of bytes from the address of this field).                                                                         |
| uint32_t   | Size of section in bytes | Size in bytes of the first section of data, this is padded to 128 bits for the next section start.                                                                                 |
| uint32_t   | Subsection count         | 1 + bone count. The first subsection offset points to a struct consisting of an offset to an array of offsets to strings and the string count.                                     |
| uint32_t[] | Subsection Offset Array  | Subsection count entries representing offsets for the start of the 64bit string offsets and string offset count plus as many 32 bit offsets to 64 bit offsets to each string.      |
| Padding    | 128 bit 0 padding        | Zero padding to align data to 128 bits.                                                                                                                                            |
| uint64_t[2]| Offset start + count     | 2 64 bit values representing the offset to the final array of offsets and the offset count. The last Offset to section start points here.                                          |
| uint64_t[] | 64 bit offset Array      | 64 bit offsets to each of the string names of each bone, also counting from the last Offset to section start                                                                       |
